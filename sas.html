    <h1>Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</h1> is a core 
    computer science discipline focused on designing 
    efficient algorithms and analyzing their performance,
     specifically time and space complexity.
      <h2><p><b>It involves creating, validating, and optimizing
         algorithms for computational problems using techniques
          like divide and conquer, greedy methods, and 
          dynamic programming. </p></b></h2>
